##Purpose: 
A proof of concept showing how to implement Blockchain.  This example also include the "Proof of Work" requirement which impedes hackers from altering the block data then rehashing the chain. It slows down the hashing process of fast computers by using a "difficulty" factor for hashing. This is also known as "Mining".

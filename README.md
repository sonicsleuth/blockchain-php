##Purpose: 
A proof of concept showing how to implement Block Chains using PHP and to provide a simple understanding of how the Block Chain concept works to protect the integrity of "blocks" of data.  This example also include the "Proof of Work" requirement which impedes hackers from altering the block data then rehashing the chain - basically it slows down the hashing process of fast computers by using a "difficulty" factor for hashing. This is also known as "Mining".
